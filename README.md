Problem Statement  Introduction  The CBSE Class 12 examination, is taken by Indian high school students at the end of K-12 school education. The scores or grades in this examination form the basis of their entry to the College or University system, for an undergraduate program. At the K-12 level, students appear for examination in five subjects. These five subjects generally include one language; three elective subjects oriented towards Science, Commerce or Humanities; and any elective of their choice as a fifth subject.      The Challenge  This challenge is based on real school data of the CBSE Class 12 examination conducted in the year 2013. You are given the grades obtained by students with specific but popular combinations of subjects (and all these students had opted for Mathematics). Their grades in four subjects are known to you. However their grade in Mathematics (i.e, the fifth subject) is hidden.
